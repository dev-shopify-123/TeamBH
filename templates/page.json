        "text": "<p>Team BH was founded by Matteo Di Penta (BH Mayo) on April 11th, 2018. As time progressed, we were able to develop a very strong and loyal connection within our community, as we actively recruited a plethora of grinders to Team BH. As a result of this, our #ReleaseTheHounds has gained over 3.7 billion impressions on Twitter and 956,000 community posts on Instagram. We are proud to say that we organically grew our community to where it stands today, while also creating new and unique content ideas that have been replicated by many others. We plan to continue our legacy by better diversifying Team BH with the guidance of our parent company Intema Solutions.Â <\/p>",
